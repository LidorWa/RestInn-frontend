          txt: "Yes! The room did look like from the pictures- the beds came in single twin beds, and even the comforter sets, the bedsheets were exactly like in the picture too! (even the curtains). \r\n\r\nI've to commend the room's cleanliness. One of the first few things that I noticed about the room when I stepped in was its clean floor- spick and span, I did not spot clumps of hair or the floor being covered in dust- that was one of the strengths of the room. \r\n\r\nSecondly, the toilet's floor was clean and there was no hair lying about the floor, or murky stains spotted about the toilet (not that I dared inspect every corner dilligently- but I stepped into the toilet barefooted, assured that it was clean)\r\n\r\nThey only provide basic body foam and shampoo, which are put into wall dispensers. I found the body soap to suffice but the shampoo was abit drying and so you might want to bring your own shampoo perhaps. \r\n\r\nCleanliness-wise, I give the sleeping area room + the toilets a 3.5 / 5 stars as I did not spot any dirt that irked me, the floors were clean enough to walk barefoot and they looked without dust. \r\nPerhaps, the only area which I did not walk barefoot much on was the doorway area as we were wearing shoes in and walking on it, during our first day. \r\n\r\nSpace-wise, it may be small, but mangeable for 2 people. I would say that it is just nice- roomy for 1 pax but just nice- slightly tight (depending on how spacey a room you are used to) for 2 people. Hong Kong is known for small room sizes though, so I thought this small room space is common.\r\nThe toilet is quite small though, and the places to hang your clothes/towels might not be as luxurious as hotels but we managed alright ultimately. There's not much space to move in the toilet. But its cleanliness and the reasonable price topped the space constraints! Bedroom wise , space is alright for 2 people.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, the room window was the only difficult thing managing as it was abit hard closing it and some slight dust.\r\n\r\nTowels and linen smelt fresh! Bedsheets felt clean!\r\nYou need to request for towels. \r\nHost was very obliging, VERY, in answering all my many questions! I emailed her TONS. \r\nKeith & Joey were on duty when we were there and both are helpful, obliging people. Joey was very friendly and helped us to check which Karaoke places were cheap and the night bus to the airport! Their guesthouse is quite systematic I feel, with either Keith or Joey(lu xiao jie) on duty at different times of the day and they give you the number to call them with a phone hung outside the reception door. \r\nKeith answered any questions we had too! \r\nThey even provided us a SIM card with internet!\r\nTHANK YOU Athena, Keith&Joey! \r\nFor this price&cleanliness, it's worth.\r\n",

Her apartment is nothing short of amazing.  It is a great size for Hong Kong, incredibly comfortable, spotlessly clean and elegantly furnished.  The apartment is an an oasis from the hustle & bustle of Hong Kong.  It is perfectly situated on Hollywood Road, in the thick of a great selection of restaurants & bars and parks and is walking distance to Central & SOHO.  The apartment is open and airy, filled with natural light and is perfect for the business person that needs space to work out of or just to have a breather from the Hong Kong pace (a real luxury for Hong Kong).  The rooftop garden is a real bonus.  What a wonderful and unique experience.  I highly recommend this to any business person and discerning traveller.  I hope to return there soon.  Thanks Barbara! :-)",

Really enjoyed the neighborhood - it was fairly quiet at night, but just a few blocks to walk to the shops and restaurants along Hollywood Road (the art/artisan shops at PMQ were our favorite). The kitchen is well equipped and there are two grocery markets within a few minutes walk (one Chinese-style and one English-style), so it was easy to make breakfast each morning, open up the balcony doors, and listen to the birds chirping in the park across the street. Barbara was very helpful with suggestions on dinner places - she gave us 6 suggestions within a 5 minute walk; we made it to 5 and had a great meal each time. The Sheung Wan area is very convenient to Central and it's easy to pick up taxis, trams, and the MTR within a few blocks of the apartment to get anywhere in the city. We'd definitely book Barbara's place again if we return to Hong Kong.",

I was on a hectic blitz like business trip and booked this apt very late at night after exhausting myself at work. Despite such a crazily short notice Barbara immediately arranged a key for me to get in without any complaints. The 24hr doorman is always so nice. I didn’t have a chance to wander around but as far as I know restaurants, convenient stores or even hospital are all downstairs and IFC (the usual working place) is just 5-10min taxi away. I’ve had some terrible experience staying at Airbnb HK previously and switched back to the boring 5 star hotel mode since then. But I would now defo place Barbara’s apt as my top choice whenever I travel to HK. I would sincerely recommend it to anyone who wants to have a down-to-earth experience in HK esp those on business trips. Last word, the pano view is amazingly refreshing - you’ll know what I’m talking about if you are familiar with the HK housing conditions ;p",

It was her first trip to the U.S. and she wanted to see New York, a real, authentic, and old New York. Bushwick is that right now. It's hip, arty, and with just enough grit to make it feel like you're in New York not the theme park that tourists end up going to. Her apartment is close to trains, some great restaurants and grocery stores, and the building is really cool. We mostly stayed out, but when we stayed in we could cook and watch Netflix like we were home. I can not stress how comfy she has made it. I really felt like I was home.

          txt: "For our first time in New York, it was somewhat courageous of us to live like locals, deep in the neighborhood of Bushwick, Brooklyn.  It took some adjusting for us to hang out in the area.  The area is considered 'gritty' which is extremely true. I cant stress that enough. It is dirty, you might be bothered for spare change, you might be asked to swipe your metro card for someone,  however the area does have some of the coolest restaurants in the city. But you must go looking for them, otherwise you will only find corner deli's that don't take international credit cards and random pawn shops etc.  We actually loved our experience at Shannon's though. Shannon's studio was great. Lots of space for two. The only complaints we had were that the walls were paper thin and it was all around a bit dirty. We washed the dishes before using them since they were dusty and just kept a fan at night to block out noise. We also could not reach Shannon until the day of our reservation and had to wait past check in time to get the keys. Once we were in contact, Shannon was super nice and helpful. The roof top is amazing! You can see some of Manhatten's skyline. The subway takes about half an hour to get to Manhatten , once you are there, probably another 15 to wherever you want to go. It is nice to get away from the zoo of Manhatten, I strongly recommend staying in Brooklyn, it's gives you more of a well rounded experience.  For us, this was great, we loved the experience of what it would be like to live there.",

          txt: "We wanted a cheap trip to Barcelona and my sister recommended we use airbnb. As it was our first airbnb experience we were a bit nervous, however it turned out to be a dream holiday. \r\nWe arrived at the flat and were met by Lola (the building guard) who gave us the keys and showed us around the apartment. It was perfect. Clean and tastefully decorated with all the kitchen appliances you could need! \r\nWe chose the apartment for the balcony and views and were blown away. You can see the whole of Barcelona from the balcony, all the way to the sea. Perfect for a sunny evening with a bottle of wine! The best thing about the balcony is that you are not overlooked by anyone. It is completely private and being so high up you are not disturbed by the noise of the road. \r\nThe flat itself is about a 10 minute walk from the metro station Guinardo and it's only a couple of minutes on the metro into town. The metro shuts around midnight so a few late nights we treated ourselves to a taxi back which cost about $11.\r\nLots of little supermarkets nearby to stock up and also several nice bars and cafes if you dont fancy the journey into town. \r\nAll in all was a perfect trip. Fantastic apartment which was great value for money. Would 100% recommend Enriques apartment and will certainly be staying again in the future.  ",

Thank you Nihat. \nRegarding the apartment, it is exactly as described. The room is nice and bed is comfortable. It was clean and well prepared for us. \nRegarding the neighborhood, it is very close to Taksim square and Istiklal Street with few minutes walk. As normal as it is in Istanbul, there is a short hill you need to walk to get to the square, which was totally fine with us. \n\nIn general, next time I visit Istanbul I would first check the availability with Nihat before searching others.",

Its just as lovely as in the photos – clean and beautiful and bright and airy and everything there that you could possibly need (even salt and pepper and pasta and tuna…AND scented candles). The place had a lovely vibe and even the bed and the pillows were comfy – and we have a Tempur at home so I’m very picky with beds!  Oh and the artwork is awesome!\r\n\r\nThe garden is lovely too and it’s a short walk to the end of the street to the beach and the national park. The beach is GORGEOUS!! Crystal clear, calm water and pretty seashells. Its also nice and protected so you don’t get blown away or sandblasted which happens on some other beaches.  Just past the beach is a path to the national park, which is so pretty. There were lots of birds and trees and beautiful giant rocks and some Aboriginal carvings. \r\n\r\nIt bucketed rain most of the weekend we were there but we still had a lovely weekend. We’ve already booked our return visit for next month. :-) Thanks Belinda! \r\n",

From the spacious living areas to the modern decor, Leila's condo is located in a prime spot with spectacular views of the Pacific Ccean. After staying at her place, I wanted to highlight 4 great things about our experience: \n\n1) Resort amenities- there is a complimentary shuttle that can take you between the Ritz Carlton and Montage resorts from your villa, along with other places in the Kapalua resort. This is great, especially for trying the top rated restaurants at the resorts without having to pay for parking...plus you can have a glass (or bottle) of wine and let someone else worry about the driving :) Or you can walk!\n\n2) Accessibility- Whether you are looking to take in a nice stroll along the beach or play a round of golf, her villa is nestled right in the heart of the Kapalua Resort. Even in the rain, you can enjoy the nice pool with a covered eating area! And I need to mention that the views from her condo are breath-taking, so if you fancy a night in, hers is the place to do it!\n\n3) Her Condo- I've stayed at hotels and resorts before, but I have to say that her villa exceeds anything you can find at a high end resorts. The wi-fi was strong and fast - able to be used among multiple devices. And the entire space was so clean! We had the security of knowing that the crew didn't just do a once over and be done, but actually took the time to make sure that it was ready and prepped for us, as if no one had stayed there before us. I'm a stickler for very nice bedrooms and beds, and hers was not only comfortable, but also offered me a great night's rest after a day of beach, beach and more beach :)\n\n4) Leila & Dan - They have been a gracious host, allowing us to stay at their condo. They were quick to respond, always providing us with best in class service, and were able to provide some great recommendations on activities and events to do on the island. \n\nI want to thank you for taking the time to read my review. Our experience staying at Leila and Dan's condo was great, and we truly enjoyed the time we spent on Maui. I cannot thank them enjoy for allowing us this great and special opportunity, and for giving us a chance to experience this beautiful island in a way that like no other. For this we are very grateful! \n\nWe wish you all the best in booking your stays through AirBnb and hope you have the opportunity to stay at Leila and Dan's condo... we hope to as well very soon! \n\nMahalo!",

The "instant book" was also really nice.  This house is on a beautiful golf course in a quiet and scenic neighborhood.  We were able to watch giant crashing waves and humpback whales from the porch.  Just lovely.',

The house had an incredible view from both the living room and the bedroom, and while there was an air conditioner, it wasn't needed due to the lovely breeze. The house is walking distance from a small beach, and is a quick drive to the Honolua General Store which has coffee, pastries, sandwiches and hot food, toiletries, towels, sunblock... pretty much everything. \n\nThe house comes equipped with travel size shampoo, body wash, hair conditioner, and bar soap. It also has a small hair dryer.\n\nThere are beach umbrellas and chairs in the backyard ready to be taken to the beach.\n\nThe wind gusts can get a little loud at times, I think because of how the house is situated on the hill. The bed was a little bit lumpy, but mostly soft and comfortable. The house renovations are gorgeous and look brand new, and there's a huge second bathroom with a great bathtub not pictured in the photos! Very clean, bright, and lovely. As other reviewers said, the photos do *not* do this house justice.\n\nOverall, it was a wonderful place to stay. Thank you!",
